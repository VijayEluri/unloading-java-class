Problem: restart a swing application for every view change.

Try #1: Java scripting. Very promise but unsuccessful. Maybe next time.

Try #2: Unload java classes, specially view classes, in runtime and reload it.

Do you want to try?

a. Run 'com.application.ui.Main' and open some views.
b. Go back to your editor (do not close the app) and edit these opened views and compile it.
c. Reopen views.

How it works?
Every time you open a view we create a brand new ClassLoader that will always look for
the class bytes from disk and you will see your modifications.

A ClassLoader for each view? Are you nuts?
Yeah, i know, this is why i use it only in development.
But remember, ClassLoader is a class, even Class is a class, so both are subject
to Garbage Collector.
